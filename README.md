# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the quality of wine based on physicochemical features. It leverages multiple classification algorithms and is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Wine quality is influenced by various chemical properties. This model uses supervised learning to classify wine samples into quality categories. The application allows users to input wine characteristics and receive a predicted quality score.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Random Forest Classifier** 🌲  
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 📈  
3. **Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPC)** 🧠

Each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing algorithm.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for EDA and visualization)
- **Streamlit** (for deployment)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains physicochemical attributes of red and white wine samples along with quality ratings.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest Classifier | XX%      | XX%       | XX%    | XX%      |
| SVM                    | XX%      | XX%       | XX%    | XX%      |
| MLPC                   | XX%      | XX%       | XX%    | XX%      |

*Replace `XX%` with your actual results.*

## 🌐 Deployment

The model is deployed using **Streamlit**. To run the app locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📸 Screenshots

*Include screenshots of your Streamlit app here if available.*
